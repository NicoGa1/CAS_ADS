# CAS_ADS
This repository hosts all the files and notebooks I need for my CAS in Applied Data Science.
For the moment it contains data for the following projects:

## 1. M2: Statistics on rents in CH
The files for the M2 project are:
- CAS_CH_Rents_Fred&Nico
- Rent prices cleaned
- Rooms_clean2

## 2. M3: ML on CIFRA10 pictures

The data for the M3 project comes from the dataset CIFRA10 from the keras.io team:
